discrete random variable
- finite domain
- pmf p(x) summing up to 1

continuous
continuous domain
prob density func integrating up to 1
descriptors moments, entropies
catigorical distribution vector of prob over the domain
usefull for choices
uniform distribution automatically implies a vector of uniform prob
over the domain. absence of a prefrence

Gaussian normal distribution
natural events/independent measurements
- mean and variance 

multivariate random variables at the same time X, Y
discrete/continuous multivariate
- product of domains of outcomes
- joint pmf,pdf p(X,Y)
distribution on all the variables is joint distribution
might be very high-dimensional
contains all probabilistic information.
- restriction only to some is marginal distribution

conditioned random vars. - relation to random variables
given another. X Y 
- a domain of outcomes
- conditional pmf/pdf 

independence of two rand variables
if and only if P(X,Y) = P(X)P(Y)

laws
Sum rule marginalization P(X) = Z P(X,Y)
product rule P(X,Y) = P(XY)P(y)

statistics
often assume that data is i.i.d 
independent samples do not affect eachother
identical distributed samples from the same distribution
