Plotting of distribution, 
the rewards will be the prices
so rewards = [0,5,10,20]
probabilities = [0.35,0.3,0.25,0.10]
E = 6
V = (x - E(x))^2
v1 = 36.5
v2 = 249

actions:
distribution
probability
expected value
variance
combined statistics

Creating agents to interact with the environment
- Having a way to use gymnasium to init the bandits. Like the slot machines
- The step function indicates that there should be an action taking plae
- need to optimize the agents to be able to interact with the bandits.

When interacting with the bandits you need to create agents. 
the function of them needs to include 
agents as render mode agent? 


agents
The agents need to have a way of interacting with the bandits. 
A module needs to be made so that we can plot and calculate the loss functions etc. 
###############
Bandits one environment needs to be solved using the three algorithms. 
epsilon greedy is a function that needs to explore the q values and then exploit the best. 

there are k decisions 
average reward of decisions i is an unknown parameter mu 
We plan to make t consecutive decisions

default params for epsilon and ucb function:
c = 2, min_epsilon= 0.01, epsilon=0.1
